# SQL Project: Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Insights

## Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Project on Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Insights. This project was part of the Codebasics SQL Project challenge. I used SQL to analyze data about consumer products and built a Power BI dashboard to show the results.

## Project Overview
Atliq Hardwares, an imaginary company, is a leading computer hardware producer in India and other countries. They need better insights to make smart decisions. To find new data analysts, their data analytics director, Tony Sharma, created a SQL challenge.

As an applicant for this role, I did the following tasks:
- Looked at the 'ad-hoc-requests.pdf' which had 9 business questions.
- Wrote SQL queries to answer these questions.
- Analyzed the data and created a Power BI dashboard to show the insights.
- Made a presentation to explain the findings to the management.

## Ad-hoc Requests
The 9 ad-hoc requests included questions about:
- Sales performance
- Customer groups
- Product profitability
- Market trends
- Inventory management
- Regional sales comparison
- Sales growth over time
- Customer buying behavior
- Forecasting future sales

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries used to get data for each of the 9 questions are included in this repository. These queries are efficient and provide accurate answers to the business questions.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard created for this project includes interactive charts and graphs that help the management to:
- Track sales performance
- Identify market trends
- Analyze customer behavior
- Make data-driven decisions

## Presentation
The insights from the data analysis were put into a presentation aimed at the top-level management. The presentation is designed to be clear and easy to understand, showing the key insights effectively.

## Conclusion
This project shows how to use SQL to get valuable insights from data and present them using a Power BI dashboard and a clear presentation. The skills demonstrated include:
- Data analysis
- SQL querying
- Data visualization
- Presentation skills

By completing this project, I have shown my ability to help the data analytics team at Atliq Hardwares make data-informed decisions.
